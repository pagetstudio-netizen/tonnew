### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript (ESM modules)
- **Session Management**: express-session with MemoryStore (development) or connect-pg-simple (production)
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth with bcrypt password hashing
- **API Design**: RESTful JSON API under `/api` prefix

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` (shared between client and server)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit with `db:push` command
- **Key Tables**: users, products, userProducts, deposits, withdrawals, withdrawalWallets, paymentChannels, tasks, userTasks, transactions, platformSettings

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User Auth**: Phone number + country + password combination
- **Session Storage**: Server-side sessions with httpOnly cookies
- **Role System**: Regular users, Admins, Super Admins
- **Middleware**: `requireAuth` and `requireAdmin` middleware for route protection

### Key Features
- **Multi-country Support**: 7 African countries with different currencies (XAF, XOF, CDF) and payment methods
- **Product System**: Virtual industrial robot products with daily earnings cycles
- **Referral System**: 3-level commission structure for team building

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database (connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable)
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database queries and schema management

### Frontend Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Accessible UI primitives (dialogs, dropdowns, tabs, etc.)
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

### Backend Libraries
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing
- **express-session**: Session management
- **memorystore**: In-memory session store for development

### Build & Development
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool with HMR
- **esbuild**: Backend bundling for production
- **TypeScript**: Type checking across full stack

### Environment Variables Required
- `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL` or `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string used for application data and sessions
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret for session encryption (required)

## Running on Replit

### Prerequisites
- Replit provides the PostgreSQL database through `DATABASE_URL`. The application can alternatively use an existing Supabase database through `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL`.
- `SESSION_SECRET` is configured as a Replit Secret.

### First-time setup
```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run dev          # start the development server on port 5000
```

The imported baseline schema must be applied before its first start. The development database is already initialized and the app now seeds countries, products, tasks, payment channels, and platform settings automatically when empty.

### Initial administrator
The initial administrator is created only when `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is configured as a secret. Existing administrator records are preserved and are not reset during startup.

### Workflow
The "Start application" workflow runs `npm run dev` and serves the app on port 5000 (mapped to external port 80).

## Recent Changes (February 2026)
- Deposit system now uses dual approach: Soleaspay (automatic) per-country OR manual recharge channels
- Admin can enable Soleaspay globally and select specific countries for automatic payment
- Users from Soleaspay-enabled countries get automatic mobile money flow (no channel selection)
- Users from non-Soleaspay countries see manual recharge channels managed by admin
- Platform setting `soleaspayEnabled` controls global Soleaspay on/off
- Platform setting `soleaspayCountries` stores comma-separated country codes (e.g. "TG,BF,CI")
- Backend enforces Soleaspay for enabled countries (cannot bypass to manual)
- InPay Africa integration still exists in backend but removed from deposit frontend
- InPay webhooks and admin balance check still functional for withdrawals

## Recent Changes (January 2026)
- Completed full frontend implementation with all pages and modals
- Implemented complete backend with all API routes
- Added database seeding for products, tasks, payment channels, and settings
- Removed emoji usage in favor of text country codes
